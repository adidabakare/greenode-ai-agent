### **AI-Powered Energy Optimization for Blockchain Transactions**

Our application is an **AI-driven agent that monitors and optimizes energy consumption in blockchain operations**, specifically targeting DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI) activities on **Sonic**. The platform will **track real-time transactions** using Ethereumâ€™s RPC methods like `eth_subscribe` and `eth_getBlockByNumber`, extracting key data such as `gasUsed`, `gasPrice`, and contract interactions. By **estimating energy consumption and carbon footprint**, the app will identify inefficient smart contracts and high-energy transactions, enabling better decision-making for developers and users.

The **OpenAI API** will serve as the **AI optimization engine**, analyzing transaction patterns and recommending **gas-efficient smart contract improvements**. This includes **loop optimizations, storage access minimization, batch processing, and L2 scaling solutions**. The app will notify contract owners through **on-chain messaging, ENS lookups, and off-chain contacts** (Twitter, GitHub) to encourage upgrades. If the contract is **upgradeable**, the AI can suggest **optimized proxy contracts or wrapper solutions** for better energy efficiency.

Beyond optimization, the app can integrate **carbon offset mechanisms** via protocols like KlimaDAO, rewarding users for low-energy interactions. A **live energy dashboard** will visualize network-wide consumption trends, helping users make informed choices. By combining **real-time transaction monitoring, AI-driven smart contract analysis, and carbon reduction strategies**, this platform will **reduce blockchainâ€™s environmental impact while improving performance and cost efficiency**. ðŸš€
